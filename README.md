uses two arduinos, two led clock style displays, a temp sensor, 3 buttons, a rocker switch, some relays, some power supplies, 
a breaker, and an over/under-voltage regulater, to actuate a fan shutter I modified to be able to be actuated open and closed 
(because apparently that doesn't exist for some reason), and switch either a fan or heater on or off,
depending on temperature. Temperature settings are programmable.
